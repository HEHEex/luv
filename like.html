            life. You have turned my
            ordinary days to extraordinary memories. Thank you for keeping up with me for the past two months. </p>
        <p class="p3">Our first date, first kiss, nee first time chorr vayil vech thanne (english aryila, pottan aay poyle ðŸŒš),  and all the time we have shared in the last two months, Im truly grateful for everything. Thank you for making these unforgettable memories with me (more to go). Remember Our first date? That was one of the best days of this year (probably the best day of my life). </p>

You are, and will always be the ONE for me. Whatever happens I always want you by my side in every moment of my life. I might
